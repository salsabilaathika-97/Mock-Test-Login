# To-do Website Test

This is a simple to-do list website using [fake REST API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a part of implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Questions
1. **What is the Use of JSON in REST APIs?** JSON is the standard for transferring data. Almost every networked technology can use JSON. REST APIs should accept JSON for request payload and also send responses to JSON.


2. **Explain how REST API works!** A REST API works essentially the same way that any website does. A call is made from a client to a server, and data is received back over the HTTP protocol. The most common HTTP method used for client request are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install node modules.

```bash
npm install
```
